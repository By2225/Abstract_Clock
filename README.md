Abstract Clock, a creative implemention of a clock

Part I: Abstract Clock
Your goal is to build a creative interpretation of the clock, focused on aesthetics and inventiveness, and make it accessible via a url. For example: 1, 2, 3. Your interpretation needs to be legible enough that your reader can visually distinguish which is the hour, the minute, vs. the second; otherwise your reader should be able to guess the time within a quarter-hour of accuracy. 
When choosing your design, consider the different states of the clock at different moments in time, e.g. when values are near max or min.
